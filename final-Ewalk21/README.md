# CS510 Final Project

**Author(s):** **Evan Walker**

## Specification

1. You have two weeks to complete your final. Work alone.
1. Read ```final-rubric.pdf``` and follow the instructions.

## Final Description

Generating Julia sets in C, generating Mandelbrot sets in C++, plotting in Python, automating workflow in bash script

## Assessment

Had some trouble in python when trying to transfer data from csv to pandas dataframe, then exporting the .png file. Also had a weird error in my C file when trying
to use sqrtl() from math.h, not sure how else to measure the magnitude of a complex number without sqrt(). Hence, my code doesn't run, tried linking math.h with -lm in my command, but that deleted my julia.c file and had to rewrite it, didnt want to mess with commands much after that. (spent many-a hours of frustration with this sqrt error, wish it wasn't the reason to stop my code from running)

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Evan Walker
