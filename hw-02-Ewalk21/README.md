**Author(s):** **CHANGEME**

## Specification

1. Continue reviewing the below resources about ```linux/bash```, ```vim```, ```git```, and ```GitHub```. Additional resources are in the info repository as needed. Test what you are learning using the Terminal in CoCalc to make sure you understand it.
    * [Linux/Bash tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) (Sections: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13)
    * [Open Vim Interactive Tutorial](http://openvim.com)
    * [The Git Parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html)
    * [tryGit Interactive Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
1. Complete the classwork, in collaboration with your group (using Slack as needed). 
1. Start reading and working through the following resources on Python to review how Python works, what its syntax is, and how basic control and data structures work. We will be diving into Python coding next week, so be prepared.
    * [Python Interactive Tutorial](http://learnpython.org/)
    * [Getting Started with the Python Language](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/language/python_language.html)
1. After finishing the classwork, solve number 3 of CW02 (generating temporary files) in 2 more ways, different from how you solved it in the classwork. Save your code in ```createfiles2.sh``` and ```createfiles3.sh```. Comment on the differences between each implementation, and discuss the pros and cons of each approach in the comments. What is the shortest implementation you can find?  Commit your code to GitHub.
1. After finishing the classwork, solve number 5 of CW02, but replace the Fibonacci numbers with the Factorials "1 2 6 24 120 . . . n!". (Recall that the `n`th factorial is defined as $n! = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(3)(2)(1)$. Save your code in ```factorial.sh```.  Commit your code to GitHub.
